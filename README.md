## RetailStudio-Gen

**RetailStudio-Gen** is an AI-assisted creative generation tool for retail brands.
It helps generate marketing creatives by uploading a product image, extracting colors, removing backgrounds, and applying ready-made design templates.
Upload a product image → remove background → generate layouts, color palettes, and creatives automatically.
Built for hackathon submission with focus on usability, speed, and AI-assisted design.

This version is a **hackathon submission MVP**. Some features are partially implemented and will be improved later.
